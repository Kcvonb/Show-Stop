practice making instances of each table/class in sqlalchemy
-use sqlal class to instantiate user or ticket or show
-use db.session.add to add instance to the session
-db.session.commit to save to db - in terminal
use that syntax to create crud fx - in crud
use crud fx to add into the seed database file

will you buy a fine dog song
